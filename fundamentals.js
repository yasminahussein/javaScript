// Coding Challenge #1
/* Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.*/

let markHeight =1.69;
let markWeight =78;
let johnHeight= 1.95;
let johnWeight =92;
console.log("BMI  for Mark = " + markWeight/ ((markHeight) ** 2));
console.log("BMI  for John = " + johnWeight/ ( (johnHeight) ** 2));


markHeight =1.88 , markWeight =95;
johnHeight= 1.76, johnWeight =85;
console.log("BMI 2 \n for Mark = " + markWeight/ (markHeight) ** 2);
console.log("BMI 20 for John = " + johnWeight/ ( johnHeight) ** 2);
